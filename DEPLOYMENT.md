# Kronos Planetary Rituals - Mobile Web App Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Kronos Planetary Rituals app as a mobile web application. The app has been enhanced with Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities to provide a native-like experience on mobile browsers.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Yarn or npm

yarn start-web-dev
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:19006

## Building for Production

To build the app for production deployment:

```bash
